# Data Engineer Workshop -001: Python Data Engineer Code Challenge

## Overview

This project is a real exercise modeled after a job interview scenario for a Data Engineer role. The objective is to:
- **Migrate data** from a CSV file into a relational database.
- **Perform data cleaning and transformation** based on specific criteria.
- **Visualize metrics** using Python libraries to generate insightful charts.

The CSV contains 50k rows of candidate data (e.g., first name, last name, email, country, application date, years of experience, seniority, technology, Code Challenge Score, and Technical Interview Score). A candidate is considered **HIRED** if both the Code Challenge Score and Technical Interview Score are greater than or equal to 7.
